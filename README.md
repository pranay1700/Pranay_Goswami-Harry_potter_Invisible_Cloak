# Pranay_Goswami-Harry_potter_Invisible_Cloak

This is my first post in github.Let's learn something interesting , lets do some magic using computer vision. I hope you all know about Harry Potter’s ‘invisible cloak’, the one he uses to become invisible. We will see how we can do the same magic trick with the help of computer vision. I will code with python and use the opencv library.
